    "\n",
    "1. How is this possible?\n",
    "2. Is this desirable?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to (1) is that this is happening because of *dropout*. Dropout refers to a layer that randomly deletes (i.e. sets to zero) each activation in the previous layer with probability *p* (generally 0.5). This only happens during training, not when calculating the accuracy on the validation set, which is why the validation set can show higher accuracy than the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of dropout is to avoid overfitting. By deleting parts of the neural network at random during training, it ensures that no one part of the network can overfit to one part of the training set. The creation of dropout was one of the key developments in deep learning, and has allowed us to create rich models without overfitting. However, it can also result in underfitting if overused, and this is something we should be careful of with our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the answer to (2) is: this is probably not desirable. It is likely that we can get better validation set results with less (or no) dropout, if we're seeing that validation accuracy is higher than training accuracy - a strong sign of underfitting. So let's try removing dropout entirely, and see what happens!\n",

    "Batch normalization (*batchnorm*) is a way to ensure that activations don't become too high or too low at any point in the model. Adjusting activations so they are of similar scales is called *normalization*. Normalization is very helpful for fast training - if some activations are very high, they will saturate the model and create very large gradients, causing training to fail; if very low, they will cause training to proceed very slowly. Furthermore, large or small activations in one layer will tend to result in even larger or smaller activations in later layers, since the activations get multiplied repeatedly across the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the development of batchnorm in 2015, only the inputs to a model could be effectively normalized - by simply subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. However, weights in intermediate layers could easily become poorly scaled, due to problems in weight initialization, or a high learning rate combined with random fluctuations in weights."

    "Batchnorm resolves this problem by normalizing each intermediate layer as well. The details of how it works are not terribly important (although I will outline them in a moment) - the important takeaway is that **all modern networks should use batchnorm, or something equivalent**. There are two reasons for this:\n",
    "1. Adding batchnorm to a model can result in **10x or more improvements in training speed**\n",
    "2. Because normalization greatly reduces the ability of a small number of outlying inputs to over-influence the training, it also tends to **reduce overfitting**."

    "As promised, here's a brief outline of how batchnorm works. As a first step, it normalizes intermediate layers in the same way as input layers can be normalized. But this on its own would not be enough, since the model would then just push the weights up or down indefinitely to try to undo this normalization. Therefore, batchnorm takes two additional steps:\n",
    "1. Add two more trainable parameters to each layer - one to multiply all activations to set an arbitrary standard deviation, and one to add to all activations to set an arbitary mean\n",
    "2. Incorporate both the normalization, and the learnt multiply/add parameters, into the gradient calculations during backprop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the weights don't tend to push very high or very low (since the normalization is included in the gradient calculations, so the updates are aware of the normalization). But it also ensures that if a layer does need to change the overall mean or standard deviation in order to match the output scale, it can do so."
